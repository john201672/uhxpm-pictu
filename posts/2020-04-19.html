                    <div class="post-content">

                        <p>Adele has announced that she has split from her husband of three years, Simon Konecki. A statement from the star's representative read: "Adele and her partner have separated. They are committed to raising their son together lovingly. As always they ask for privacy." The couple married in 2016 after five years of dating, and welcomed their son, six-year-old Angelo, in 2012. The wedding was kept secret, with Adele only announcing the news at the 2017 Grammys when she thanked her new husband.</p>
                        <p><img src="/img/p1.png"><p>Adele and Simon at the 2017 Grammy Awards</p></p>
                        <p>"I'm married! My husband, my son, you're the only reason I do it," she said at the time. She later spoke about the early days of falling in love to an Australian audience during a performance in March 2017, saying: "And I am addicted to that feeling. Obviously, I can not go through those feelings because I'm married now. I've found my next person."</p>
                        <p>The award-winning singer is well-known for being incredibly private about her relationships and personal life, and only rarely stepped out in public with Simon. Her spokespeople have confirmed that she will make no further comment on the separation.</p>
                        <p>Loading the player...</p>
                        <p>In a rare interview with Vogue in 2016, Adele opened up about life as a parent and her bond with Simon. "[Angelo] makes me very proud of myself. When I became a parent, I felt like I was truly living. I had a purpose, where before I didn’t," she confessed. "I can't have any other junk in my head to worry about as well [as him]."</p>
                        <p>"When I met Simon I knew something was going to happen," she said, adding that he had helped her through her recovery following surgery on her vocal cords in 2011. Rumours are that Adele is set to release a new album in 2019 – and fans have defended her on social media after some speculated how the split would affect her songwriting. "Imagine ending a seven-year relationship that produced a child and the first thing that the world says is 'Yassss a new album!' Do better, world. Adele’s been good to you," one wrote on Twitter.</p>
                        <p> Adele has filed for divorce from Simon Konecki, according to legal documents filed in the US. The divorce papers were lodged at a court in Los Angeles, five months after the Hello singer confirmed she and her husband had parted ways following three years of marriage.</p>
                        <p>The 31-year-old began dating Simon in 2011, and they welcomed their son Angelo together the following year. The pair mostly kept their relationship out of the public eye, but Adele publicly addressed their secret wedding during an acceptance speech at the 2017 Grammys. In her speech, she said: "Grammys, I appreciate it. The Academy, I love you. My manager, my husband and my son, you're the only reason I do it." She later spoke about the early days of falling in love to an Australian audience during a performance in March 2017, saying: "And I am addicted to that feeling. Obviously, I cannot go through those feelings because I'm married now. I've found my next person."</p>

                        <p>Confirming the couple’s split in April, Adele’s representative said they remained "committed to raising their son together lovingly".</p>
                        <p>Since the breakup, Adele appears to have been focusing on having fun with friends, sharing photos of her summer break on Instagram, where she could be seen lounging on a private yacht and exploring the beautiful scenery at their holiday destination.</p>
                        <p>The 31-year-old has also unveiled her own weight loss transformation, with reports suggesting she had shed more than a stone after taking up Reformer Pilates with her close friend Ayda Field. Praising her friend’s "incredible" figure in July, Spice Girls singer Mel C said she had seen Adele in the gym, telling SiriusXM: "She was on the treadmill. She looks incredible, she is working out hard."</p>
